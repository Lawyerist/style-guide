Lawyerist Style Guide
=====================

This style guide covers just a few issues we commonly see. It is brief because its purpose is to express some stylistic preferences, not to create a comprehensive (and onerous to follow) style guide. Please read it and follow it when writing for *Lawyerist.com*. For any other questions of style, refer to the *Chicago Manual of Style*.

Pronouns
--------

When you are writing about someone, use *he* or *she* if it is obvious, use the subject’s preferred pronoun if you know it or can discover it, or else use *they*/*their*.

If you are giving an example in which gender is irrelevant or you just need a neutral pronoun, use *they*/*their*.


Punctuation
-----------

### Spaces Between Sentences

Use only one space after a period/between sentences.


### Titles of Things

Titles of books and websites (including blogs) go in italics. Titles of news articles, blog posts, and academic papers go in quotation marks.


### Dashes

Em dashes, en dashes, and hyphens serve different purposes, and you should use them appropriately.

An *em* dash—used to indicate a break in thought or shift in tone—should look like it does in this sentence: a long stroke *without* spaces between it and the words that surround it.

Microsoft Word will automatically correct two hyphens to an em dash. In WordPress, use three hyphens. If you use a Mac, you can use ⌥⇧- to create an em dash. You can also long-press the hyphen key on iOS.

An *en* dash is for indicating a range, such as “2–4 posts per day,” and as a compound adjective hyphen, such as “Civil War–era.” In practice, most people just use a hyphen instead, so you never need to use an en dash if you don’t want to.

Microsoft Word will automatically change space-hyphen-space to an en dash, and then you can remove the spaces manually. WordPress will, too, but if you need an en dash without spaces around it in WordPress, use two hyphens. On a Mac, use ⌥-, and you can long-press the hyphen key on iOS.

*Note: many people use space-hyphen-space in Word instead of a proper em dash. However, that creates an *en* dash, not an *em* dash. Please do it properly.*


### Ellipses

The BlueBook says an ellipsis should be three periods with spaces between them, but that is actually a pain to do properly because you need to use non-breaking spaces to prevent the ellipsis from breaking at the end of a line. Plus, it just looks like you don't know how to type. Use a proper ellipsis character.

As with the em dash, use spaces on either side of an ellipsis. If the ellipsis ends the sentence, include a period (or other punctuation mark) after the ellipsis.

Word will automatically correct three periods without spaces between them to an ellipsis. So will WordPress. On a Mac, use ⌥;. You can long-press the period key on iOS.


### Capitalization

Titles and headings should be capitalized using [title
case](http://www.dailywritingtips.com/rules-for-capitalization-in-titles/) as outlined in the _Chicago Manual of Style_. An exception to the title case rule is for how-to guides. The preposition "to" is always capitalized. 

### Inline Numbered Lists

When you include a numbered list in a sentence, use full parentheses around the numbers, like so:

> Problems are less likely to arise in this situation because the successor is: (1) experienced; (2) already being paid out of current revenue; and (3) already knows many of the clients or is fully capable of serving them.


Words to Avoid
--------------

Don’t over-use contractions.

Here are words we don't want to see:

Instead of this | Use this
:-------------- | :-------
leads           | potential clients
oftentimes      | often
utilize         | use
upon            | on


Other Things to Avoid
---------------------

* Rhetorical questions
* Emoji
