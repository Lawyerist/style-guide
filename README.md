This style guide is for contributors to Lawyerist.com. It is brief because its purpose is to express some stylistic preferences, not to create a comprehensive (and onerous to follow) style guide.

For convenience, [lawyerist.com/style](https://lawyerist.com/style) is redirected to lawyerist-style-guide.md.
